# DIG4503-Spring2021-0077
This here is the repository for all of my individual senior year React projects while I was studying the framework in DIG4503. You'll find many different ones, namely those focused on client and server communication with NoSQL. The culmination of my work is located in "portfolio2", where I developed a crude Pokemon team manager with two concurrent React instances.
